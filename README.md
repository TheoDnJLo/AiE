## Inspiration

According to World Health Organization (WHO), **at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment**, globally. In at least 1 billion ‚Äì or almost half ‚Äì of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Vision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden with the annual global costs of productivity losses associated with vision impairment from uncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone estimated to be US$ 244 billion and US$ 25.4 billion.

There is substantial variation in the causes between and within countries according to the availability of eye care services, their affordability, and the eye care literacy of the population. Among children, the causes of vision impairment vary considerably across countries. For example, in low-income countries congenital cataract is a leading cause, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity. As in adult populations, uncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children.

Now, coming to the same limelight, medical treatments have become very expensive nowadays. So, don't they have the right to lead a normal life? We believe everyone does, hence we bring forth the remedy spark with the help of Technology and that's why we made AiE.
